# Alpha_compiler
*A compiler for *Alpha* programming language (project for CS340 course in University Of Crete)*
## Basic idea:
- Create lexical analizer using *flex/lex*
- Create syntax analyzer using *yacc/bison*
- Create symbol table after syntax analize is done
- Create intermidiate low level code (fake instructions) of Alpha
- Construct final machine code (executable) and virtual machine for an execution enviroment
